# Sleep Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict sleep disorders, specifically **Insomnia** and **Sleep Apnea**, by analyzing various health metrics. [cite_start]As a student researcher, I focused on identifying how factors like sleep duration and physical activity impact overall sleep quality[cite: 21, 22].

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* [cite_start]**Language:** Python [cite: 8]
* [cite_start]**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn [cite: 24]
* **Approach:** Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)

## 🚀 Key Features & Process
1. [cite_start]**Data Pre-processing:** Cleaned and formatted health datasets to ensure model accuracy[cite: 23].
2. [cite_start]**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed EDA to find correlations between lifestyle habits and sleep disorders[cite: 23].
3. [cite_start]**Model Training:** Utilized Scikit-learn to train a predictive model[cite: 8, 24].

## 💡 Challenges I Faced
* [cite_start]**Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values in complex health datasets was a challenge, which I solved using Pandas[cite: 23].
* **Accuracy:** Tuning the model to distinguish correctly between Insomnia and Sleep Apnea required multiple iterations.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:
* [cite_start]Implementing Machine Learning workflows[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]Understanding real-world applications of Data Science in healthcare[cite: 22].
