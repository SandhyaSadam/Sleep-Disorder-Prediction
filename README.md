# Sleep Disorder Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict sleep disorders, specifically Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, by analyzing various health metrics. As a student researcher, I focused on identifying how factors like sleep duration and physical activity impact overall sleep quality.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Approach:** Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)

## 🚀 Key Features & Process
1. **Data Pre-processing:** Cleaned and formatted health datasets to ensure model accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed EDA to find correlations between lifestyle habits and sleep disorders.
3. **Model Training:** Utilized Scikit-learn to train a predictive model.

## 💡 Challenges I Faced
* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values in complex health datasets was a challenge, which I solved using Pandas.
* **Accuracy:** Tuning the model to distinguish correctly between Insomnia and Sleep Apnea required multiple iterations.

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
* Implementing Machine Learning workflows.
* Understanding real-world applications of Data Science in healthcare.
